Recap:

Topics:

  callback function ---> a function which is used an arguement to another function to execute a set of statements

  async operations execution 
    Eg: setTimout, setInterval
  
  async operations are put into a queue after the wait time/ or completion of action.
  then js grabs them from the queue for execution

  advantages of callback
    1. Modularity
    2. Reusability
    3. Readablity

  disadvantage of callback
    callback hell
  
  Promise: 
    Promise Object - completion or failure of an async operation
    States:
      pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
      fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
      rejected: meaning that the operation failed. with a reason
    
    Accessing Values or Fullfill/Reject:
      then ---> executed when promise is Fullfilled
      catch ---> executed when promise is rejected
      finally for final statements irrespective fulfilled/reject 
    
    Promise Chain:
      Chaining of fullfilled promise with help of then block 
      Any error in the chain will break the chain and will caught in catch block 
  
    disadvantage of Promise: 
      Too much of Chaining leads to uncertain behavior
